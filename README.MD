# Voice Remote for Home Assitant
This is a ESPHome based device able to interact with voice assistants configured in Home Assistant. 

## Project Timeline
Initially I thought about this kind of project when I saw [$13 voice remote for Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/thirteen-usd-voice-remote/){:target="_blank"} article. 
I tried to buy one **M5Stack ATOM Echo Development Kit** but at that time it was out of stock almost everywhere I looked and it was pretty hard to source in my country. 
As a result, this idea transitioned to PENDING state until I find an M%Stack of a different approach. 

Some time later, thanks to the gods of youtube algorithms :smile: I found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeUG3Si9fZk){:target="_blank"} where the author describes very well an alternative for the M5Stakc ATOM kit using esp32 based development board called **Adafruit Feather v2 ESP32 board**, which again was not very easy to find and source from my country. 
So I decided to make my own adaptation of the project using plain ESP32 module and a custom PCB because I like to design PCBs and I like when the project is nice and tidy. 

The original github repository for this project is [this](https://github.com/techdregs/Home-Assistant-Voice-Remote){:target="_blank"}
